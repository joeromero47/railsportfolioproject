# Game-Ratings

The video game rating library is an application I built to rate your video games that you own and to organize them to find them by rating. This application is useful to keep track of games you have played and rated. Future stretch goal is to see other users' ratings and to comment on their ratings.

## Installation

Visit https://github.com/joeromero47/railsportfolioproject to download the project. 

## Usage
Start program by running rails s. The program will prompt you to log in or sign in when you direct your browser to localhost:3000. You may also sign in using Facebook. Follow the url links to sign up and then log in when it directs you to the log in page. At your games/index page you will see an empty list as a new user since you have yet to add any games. Simply click on add a new game and you will be able to enter a name and assign a rating. Clicking submit will save it to your list. Clicking the name on the list will allow you to edit the game or delete it. Log out when finished.
